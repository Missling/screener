I worked on a team of 4 engineers to build SwipeSee, a mobile app that displays curated lists of tourist attractions organized by cities where users have the options to like and dislike. SwipeSee is a single-page, responsive applications. Users can view a curated list of popular tourist attractions by cities, and have the option to like and dislike the cities and attractions. By taking the initiative to write tests using Rspec and Capybara, I insured that changes made to the application would not break the code -- reducing the cost of future development. This proved to be important as we added new features and scaled the application by restructuring the database with the addition of more attractions.
